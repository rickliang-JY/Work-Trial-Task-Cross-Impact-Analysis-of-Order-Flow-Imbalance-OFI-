# Work-Trial-Task-Cross-Impact-Analysis-of-Order-Flow-Imbalance-OFI-

python package: pandas  numpy statsmodels sklearn.linear_model  warnings
I create a ofi.py file which implements the caculation method of OFI, plz import it as a package when you run the script

Run the contemporaneous.py and future.py scripts you can get the refression results and the ofi data(stockname_combined.csv)

There is no data prepossessing file and you can find that in each scripts, there are the input data to load the data. 

Since the data file is quite large, I would show the example of original data file that may be used in this project

example dataname: AAPL20241230.csv
and you can download the data from the Databento
